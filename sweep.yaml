# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Add docstrings to all functions and file headers."
  - "All classes and functions must have a description of their purpose and example usage on the next line after their definition. Use triple quotation marks to do that: """ explanation here """."
  - "Follow PEP8"
# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
